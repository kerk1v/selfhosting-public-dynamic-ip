How to self-host services on a Home Server, yet expose them to the public internet

### The problem: 

You have a load of services running on your Homeserver or Homelab? You have a decent Internet connection with high bandwidth but your ISP doesn't give you a static IP address, so you're either stuck with a dynamic IP. Or even worse, your ISP uses CGNAT (Carrier Grade Network Address Translation) so you don't have a public, routable IP address at all?  

Fear no more, as you can make your services - and only the ones you chose - available from the internet for a handful of €uros a month. 

### What do I need? 

A cheap hosted server or VM. I am personally very fond of Hetzner Cloud, a german no-frills but very reliable hosting and cloud provider. You can get their most affordable ARM cloud instances for less than 5€ a month (price chages depending on your national VAT rate) and get roughly 4 months for free (20€ Cloud credit) if you use my referral link: https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=uuMclGJHJMf4
